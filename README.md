# Sentinel Litigation
> The firm is called Sentinel Litigation and I am the founding attorney.  You can find a bio of me on DePaul Law's website, which I think is still up.  Competition is broad as I handle everything except criminal matters in both state and federal court but I specialize in cases where a person, family, or entity have been defrauded or are the victims of consumer fraud, which is rampant, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision upholding arbitration clauses in consumer contracts and also upholding clauses that prohibit coming together as a class and limiting people to bringing any complaints through arbitration, but there are many loopholes, including the ability to bring small claims actions and banding together in what amounts to an in--state quasi class action.
> Here's the law firm that is most well known for doing consumer fraud work: https://www.edcombs.com/  But since I am doing a brand name and not my name, I want my website to look bold without being brash or ostentatious, subtlely aggressive, and through succinct and powerful wording, suggesting to prospective clients that I am intellectually akin to Gore Vidal and Herbert Marcuse and as experienced as a tranny hooker at 4 am on a Monday night.
